# Drinking Water Potability Prediction 🚰

This project predicts whether drinking water is **safe or not** using machine learning models based on physicochemical features.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- `ph`
- `Hardness`
- `Solids`
- `Chloramines`
- `Sulfate`
- `Conductivity`
- `Organic_carbon`
- `Trihalomethanes`
- `Turbidity`
- `Potability` (Target: 1 = Safe, 0 = Not Safe)

## 📊 ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📁 File Description
- `Drinking_Water_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ✅ Output
The model evaluates various algorithms and compares their performance to find the best predictor for safe drinking water.
